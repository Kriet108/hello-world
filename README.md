Sebastian here.

...I'm always a bit overwhelmed by blank files on white screens (or maybe I'm just more comfortable with the darker themes on text editors...).  It just seems like they're EXPECTING something.

On a more serious note, I'm a java dev by trade, though by no means does that mean that that's all I do.  I'm an avid Unity3d amateur, I taught myself the basics of JS by making a sudoku solver (which may or may not get uploaded here), and I'll probably pick up whatever languages I can manage.  Broaden the horizons and all that.

...And with that bit of whitespace anxiety quashed, this is Sebastian, signing off.
